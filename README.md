# Fieldnotes

Here are the [notes](https://pixelchrome.org/notes) I've taken during my work and for projects in my sparetime. Mainly for my own usage.

# Prerequisites

```sh
npm install postcss-cli
npm install autoprefixer
```

# Theme Docsy

The theme I use for this is [docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) and it is located in `../themes/docsy` to keep this project clean.

# Preview

```sh
hugo --themesDir=../themes server -D
```
